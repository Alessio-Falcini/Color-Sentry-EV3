# Color-Sentry-EV3
Bi-directional Client-Server system for LEGO EV3, leveraging TCP/IP Sockets. The EV3 (Pybricks Server) streams real-time color readings from its sensor. The Desktop GUI (Python/Tkinter Client) displays this data and sends remote motor control commands back to the robot. A digital sentry for remote monitoring and control.
